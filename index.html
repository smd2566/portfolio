            <p>My name is <b>Shane Doherty</b>, and I am a graduate software developer for games and interactive media at Rochester Institute of Technology. I enjoy working with others to create meaningful products, and to solve problems through collaboration. I find that it is important to learn from mistakes and to seek insight if unexpected problems occur. I have experience in C#, Java, JavaScript, Unity, Python, C++, and API frameworks. I look forward to working with others, and gaining meaningful experience in the software development and interactive media industries.</p>
